# Sakura_card
A game in development
# Game Introduction
Sakura_card game is a game based on the cards in a comic "Card Captor Sakura". The cards are exactly the same as the cards in the comic twenty years ago, and the effect of the cards and regulations are originated.
# Game Setting
In this game, players take turns to use attacking cards to attack others and defending cards to protect themselves from the attack of others. All players have one hp at the beginning of the game and max hp is not limited.
The player number of the game is not specified. There is no repeating cards in the deck and since the total amount of the cards is only 52, the recommended amount of player is 4-6.
The dealing deck will be shuffled whenever it is empty.
# Game Flow
The game starts with all players drawing card until they have 5 cards in the hand in a counterclockwise order. Then the first player starts his/her turn.
Each turn is composed of two parts: judging stage and dealing stage. If the player has some cards in his/her judging area, he/she should first carry out the judgement with the instruction of the card. In the dealing stage, the player can deal any cards that his/her wants to use. The player can end his/her turn whenever he/she wants.
Then the other players play their turn in a counterclockwise order. When all the players finish their turn, all players draw cards until they have 5 cards in the hand in the order same with the order in the beginning.
When there is only one player left, the game is over and the left player is the winner.
# Card effects
Detailed card effects for all cards is not included in this session.
We mainly divides cards according to their effects into three kinds: attacking card, defending card and skill card.
For the attacking cards and the defending cards, they have their own star level to identify their power. For an attacking card with one star, it can be defended by a defending card with more than one star. For an attacking card with two stars it can be defended by one defending card with more than two stars or by two defending cards with one star. Note that Some special attacking-defending rules are applied for some cards and the special rules are of higher priority.
Some cards are both an attacking card and a defending card and they can act as either an attacking card or a defending card at a single time.
There are six special cards, called "element card", which are #1Windy, #14Light, #23 Firey, #27Dark, #28Watery, #52Earthy. For Windy, Firey, Watery, Earthy, two defending cards with less than three stars or one element card is required to dodge or they will cause 1 damage. For Light and Dark, two defending cards with less than 3 stars or one element card is required to dodge or they will cause 2 damage. If a player only uses one valid defending card with less than 3 stars, they will be dealt 1 damage. There are also some special attacking-defending rules for the element cards and these special rules are of higher priority.
The skill cards have some special effects, such as ignoring one's turn, drawing more cards or entering special modes, etc. Detailed information is written in the instruction of the cards.
The cards can be dealed as a combination and have a more powerful effect on others. The combination is not arbitrary and the specific combinations with other cards are written in the instruction of each card.
# Elaboration on Every Card's Effects
## Note for combo attack: 
Total damage is calculated by simply adding on the damage each card in this combo will cause. Several combos may cause more damage. See details below.<br />
Number of defending cards to fully dodge combo attacks follows this rule: number of defending cards for every attacking card in the combo plus 1 more for special effect.<br />
**Example:** A combo of 1 windy and 1 watery card needs 5 less-than-three-star defending cards or 2 element cards to dodge. <br />
Partial dodge is allowed.<br />
